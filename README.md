# What is Ludonium?
Ludonium is an application that takes in donated game keys, and give back to the Discord community through giveaways.  
This project was made to prevent bots scraping keys from chat that are given away by community members of a Discord server.  

It prevents members of the community from also ghosting the user whom has given away the key.  
(**Showing of appreciation is always nice to see**)

## How does it work?
Once a user has donated a key, the key will be encrypted into the database and a giveaway will be initiated on the server.  
People in the community will be able to participate by reacting to the message.  
After a set amount of time has passed a winner will be selected and a DM will be sent to the winner by a bot with the key. 

### Is it done? 
No, I'm still actively working on this. It's not finished and it still has a way to go. Figuring things out as I develop.

#### Setting it up
I'll fill this in once the project is close to being fully functional.
